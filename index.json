Second, when the join selectivity is low, we present improvements upon the state-of-the-art with a view to decreasing the communication cost and the maximum load a reducer can receive, taking also into account the load imbalance across the reducers.","tags":["Distributed framework","Apache Hadoop","Map-Reduce","Apache Spark","HDFS","Theta-Join","Similarity Join","Databases","Scalability","Data Engineering","Data Management"],"title":"Binary Theta-Joins using MapReduce: Efficiency Analysis and Improvements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christos Zigkolis","Savvas Karagiannidis","Ioannis Koumarelas","Athena Vakali"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
