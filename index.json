First, we show that the best known algorithm to date for this problem can reach the optimal trade-off between the size of the input a reducer can receive and the incurred communication cost when the join selectivity is high. Second, when the join selectivity is low, we present improvements upon the state-of-the-art with a view to decreasing the communication cost and the maximum load a reducer can receive, taking also into account the load imbalance across the reducers.","tags":["Distributed framework","Apache Hadoop","Map-Reduce","Apache Spark","HDFS","Theta-Join","Similarity Join","Databases","Scalability","Data Engineering","Data Management"],"title":"Binary Theta-Joins using MapReduce: Efficiency Analysis and Improvements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christos Zigkolis","Savvas Karagiannidis","Ioannis Koumarelas","Athena Vakali"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"234ed34218b9886a56e2d029a5bbe50d","permalink":"/publication/item_recommendation/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/item_recommendation/","section":"publication","summary":"Collaborative recommenders rely on the assumption that similar users may exhibit similar tastes while content-based ones favour items that found to be similar with the items a user likes. Weak related entities, which are often considered to be useful, are neglected by those similarity-driven recommenders. To take advantage of this neglected information, we introduce a novel dissimilarity-based recommender that bases its estimations on degrees of dissimilarities among items‚Äô attributes.","tags":["Recommender Systems","Dissimilarity recommender","Distributed framework","Item Recommendation","Learnt Similarity Measure","Transfer Learning","Knowledge Transfer","Entity Resolution","Duplicate Detection","Record Linkage","Data Matching"],"title":"Integrating similarity and dissimilarity notions in recommenders","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
