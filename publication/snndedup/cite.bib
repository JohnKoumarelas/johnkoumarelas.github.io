abstract = {The integration of multiple data sources is a common problem in a large variety of
applications. Traditionally, handcrafted similarity measures are used to discover,
merge, and integrate multiple representations of the same entity—duplicates—into a
large homogeneous collection of data. Often, these similarity measures do not cope
well with the heterogeneity of the underlying dataset. In addition, domain experts
are needed to manually design and configure such measures, which is both time-consuming
and requires extensive domain expertise.We propose a deep Siamese neural network,
capable of learning a similarity measure that is tailored to the characteristics of
a particular dataset. With the properties of deep learning methods, we are able to
eliminate the manual feature engineering process and thus considerably reduce the
effort required for model construction. In addition, we show that it is possible to
transfer knowledge acquired during the deduplication of one dataset to another, and
thus significantly reduce the amount of data required to train a similarity measure.
We evaluated our method on multiple datasets and compare our approach to state-of-the-art
deduplication methods. Our approach outperforms competitors by up to +26 percent F-measure,
depending on task and dataset. In addition, we show that knowledge transfer is not
only feasible, but in our experiments led to an improvement in F-measure of up to
+4.7 percent.},
